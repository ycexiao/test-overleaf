% This template file and associated class and style files produce documents in
% a preprint style suitable for submission and review purposes.
% The iucrjournals.cls requires a small selection of packages from standard TeXLive
% distributions and contains a minimal set of macros to define content and apply
% formatting. BibTeX and iucr.bst should be used for references (using harvard.sty).
% If you wish to use additional packages, please reference them in this document and
% please only use packages included in standard TeXLive distributions in order to
% avoid compilation problems during the submission process.
